## Blackjack Project
#### Week 4 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
Blackjack acts as a simple Blackjack program. Allowing the player to go up against a computer
dealer and try to win. Instructions are initially printed on how to play to include the rules,
card values, and trying to score 21 without going over. After that it's a yes/no or 1/2 for options going
through the game.

### Technologies Used
* Java
* Atom
* Git
* Google

### Lessons Learned
Just more practice on instantiating objects, creating methods, classes and now working with enums.
Every weekend project has been helping me to develop the thought process of how to put these
programs together, my brain still shorts out every so often in the logic, but it is getting better.

### Stretch Goals
Being able to reliably set a soft Ace, value of 1, or a hard Ace, value of 11, would have been nice.
A greater goal was to have been able to create other computer players that the user could name, or
just offer default npc names.
